	<p class="para"><h3>Finance is a broad term that describes activities associated with banking, leverage or debt, credit, <br>capital markets, money, and investments. Basically, finance represents money management and<br> the process of acquiring needed funds. Finance also encompasses the oversight, creation, and study of money, banking,<br> credit, investments, assets, and liabilities that make up financial systems.Many of <br>the basic concepts in finance originate from micro and<br> macroeconomic theories. One of the most fundamental theories is the time value of money, which essentially states<br> that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future.


Since individuals, businesses, and government entities<br> all need funding to operate, the finance field includes three main sub-categories: personal finance, corporate finance<br>, and public (government) finance.


Personal Finance
Financial planning involves analyzing the <br>current financial position of individuals to formulate strategies for future needs within financial constraints. Personal finance<br> is specific to every individual's situation and activity; therefore, financial strategies depend largely on the person's earnings, living <br>requirements, goals, and desires.

For example, individuals must save for retirement, which requires saving or investing enough money<br> during their working lives to fund their long-term plans. This type of financial management <br>decision falls under personal finance.</h3>
